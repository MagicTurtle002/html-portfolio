<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Dan Vincent Teodoro, and I'm currently a student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. 
  I'm passionate about web development and am currently honing my skills in HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Building websites has become a fascinating journey for me. While I'm still in the learning phase, 
  I've already embarked on creating my own portfolio using HTML. 
  It's a work in progress, but I'm excited about the possibilities it holds.</p>

<p>Recently, I delved into CSS by building a website inspired by Borcelle Bakery, 
  a project I undertook with the aid of tutorials on YouTube. 
  It was a rewarding experience that not only enhanced my understanding of CSS but also 
  ignited my creativity in web design.</p>
<p>
  As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in web development, I look forward to incorporating CSS into my portfolio and exploring more advanced techniques. Through perseverance and dedication, 
  I aim to become proficient in crafting visually appealing and functional websites that leave a lasting impression.</p>
  
<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and feel free to explore my projects and journey in web development!</p>
